## Generative AI Assignment: Personalized AI Tool

**Goal:** Gain experience using GenAI techniques and building a simple AI tool that provides personalized responses using at least one external data source.

### Requirements:

* **Single Function:** Your tool must do one specific task well (e.g., provide weather, summarize emails, make recommendations, etc.)
* **External Data:** Use a CSV, PDFs, Docs, Images, API, website data, etc to get the "knowledge" your AI needs.
* **Personalization:** Tailor responses to the user (you AI should ask for additional info if needed).
* **Working MVP:** Your code must work. It can all be done within a notebook, basic script, or deployed in Streamlit, a web app framework, or something different. 

### Deliverables:
* Short demo video showing how you interact with the code (email d.zaratsian@gmail.com the link to your video)
* Working code (emailed to d.zaratsian@gmail.com as a .zip)

### Stretch Goals (optional, but some ideas):
* **LLM chaining/agents:** Combine multiple LLMs or leverage AI agents.
* **Multimodal features:** Include video, image, or audio search or understanding as part of your AI tool.
* **UI:** Develop a UI potentially using Streamlit, a JS framework, or whatever you can spin up quickly.
